## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Initial release. Sealed Storage SPA:
  - Encrypt a file under a registry-driven policy (nft-gate, time-lock), store the ciphertext on
    Walrus (HTTP publisher), and download a portable manifest.
  - Decrypt from a manifest: fetch ciphertext, mint a Seal SessionKey via one wallet signature, and
    download the plaintext.
  - Testnet-first with a mainnet-pending notice (Seal committee mode is testnet-only).
